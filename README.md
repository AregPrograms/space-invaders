# space invaders
As a fun project, I decided to make Space Invaders, but reimagined as a modern-ish game.

## To-do list

- Upgrades: Small buttons to upgrade your stats. (health, power)
- Powerups: Random collectables that spawn on the map that temorarily give effects (heal, strength)
- Coins: Collectables dropped by enemies, used to purchase upgrades.
- Game Over/Death: Triggered when you die ingame.
- Multiplayer: You will be able to connect with people on your network, or worldwide if you set up your own server (GCP tutorial soon).

## <sup>Extra</sup> Features

- Discord Rich Presence ( ty for idea, [jased-0001](https://github.com/Jased-0001) ) <sup>now your friends know that you are playing funny atari game
